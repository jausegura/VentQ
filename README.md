# VentQ
Ventilation quality monitoring system

VentQ is an open-source IoT-based system for CO2 and Temp/Hum monitoring. In this development, the sensing nodes are based on NodeMCU ESP8266.

The list of materials for the sensing node are:

- CO2 sensor (MH-Z19B)
- Temperature/Humidity sensor (DHT22)
- OLED screen
- RGB led
- NodeMCU ESP8266
